Taking only classes helps them because at their house they'll be pay more attention. They will be comfortable at home. The hardest part of school is getting ready. You wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. After you think you picked an outfit u go look in the mirror and you'll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then you'll have to change. With the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you won't need to stress about what to wear. Most students usually take showers before school. They either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. Some students do both to smell good. That causes them do miss the bus and effects on their lesson time because they come late to school. When u have online classes u won't need to miss lessons because you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go. When your home your comfortable, and you pay attention. It gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. Public schools are difficult even if you try. Some teacher don't know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. That causes students to fail, and they may repeat the class.  "

Sometimes you need to wake up and look what is around you because problems are the best way to change what you want to change a long time ago. Problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok.First it can make you see different from the others. For example I remember that when I came to the United States I think that nothing was going to change me because I think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but I remember that I was really shy but I think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that I never see in my life but I just need to see it from a different way and don't let nothing happened and ruing the change that I want to make because of just a problem. For example I think that nothing was going to change me and that i don't need to be shy anymore became I need to start seeing everything in a different way because you can get mad at every one, but you need to know what is going to happen after, people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and don't let anything or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and can't do anything about it because is your choice and your problems, and you can decide what to do with it. Second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems, but she has faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and I'm not scare of high I did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time I see my mom in an airplane it makes me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but I see it from a different way and I like the high, but also she has to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can not be the same as you. For example I think that my mom and me are different because we are and I have to understand that she does not like high and I need to understand that. To help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons' life. A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand. Everyone has a different opinion and a different was to understand then others. Everyone can see the different opinion and what other people think."
00299B378633,3.0,3.5,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.5,"Dear, Principal u change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they can't go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. That's like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they can't because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isn't that bad, its higher than a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, that's means that they in ain't going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they can't play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students can't go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves, but we shouldn't take the other students away from the others ones. If we do this policy student will try to raise their grade but if they can't what happens they them. Should they just be out of it and think that schools boarding? If they do this its like taking away their video games. All I'm saying is that they have the right to go out for sports or activities."
003885A45F42,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.5,4.0,5.0,"The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become happier, and you respect others. First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what you're doing. Because you're defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they don't make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they don't want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because they're afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. It's hard to make your own choices, but one day you're going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature, the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what you're doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day It's your life, and you do what you think is right. Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities, and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like they're happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, they're depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says ""Those who know God should love others, because God is love."" Not being yourself will get you depressed because you don't do everything you want to do, but you do what others want to do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they don't want to do just to fit in, because they don't want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they won't be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what he's doing since it's his friends. Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also, some kids don't like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says"" Honor your father and mother."" If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting others should be really important, because you don't want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect, and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid don't watch, and stand up for them, don't be afraid to stand up for someone because you're doing the right thing. Some may disagree with me and say that it's not that big of a deal, and it doesn't feel like a big accomplishment. But with all due respect, I agree that it's a big accomplishment because nowadays, it's really hard to become yourself. In conclusion, It's hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you, and you're afraid to fight it back. That's why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. "

Another example of an act of kindness is when you help your friends to study for a test or explain them or when they need money you give some money is an act of kindness because you are helping your friend. Another example is not trowing trash on the floor if you put the trash where belong that is an act of kindness because benefits the earth and the people.  "
